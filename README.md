# demo-tui-rs

This is a testing repo for experimenting with aspects of `tui-rs`.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run
```

Then within the app:

```
Ctrl-c, or q - Quit
Up Arrow - Increase sleep duration
Down Arrow - Decrease sleep duration
s - Sleep
```

The app in its current state tests a few key-bindings, and async actions.
